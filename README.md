# COVID-19 pandemic in India

The COVID-19 pandemic in India is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in India, which originated from China, was reported on 30 January 2020.[5] Currently, India has the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia.[6] As of 12 June 2021, India has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world (after the United States) with 29.3 million reported cases of COVID-19 infection and the third-highest number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and Brazil) at 367,081 deaths.[7][8][9]

The first cases of COVID-19 in India were reported in the towns of Thrissur, Alappuzha and Kasargod, all in the state of Kerala, among three Indian medical students who had returned from Wuhan.[10][11] Lockdowns were announced in Kerala on 23 March, and in the rest of the country on 25 March. By mid-May 2020, five cities accounted for around half of all reported cases in the country: Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai and Thane.[12] On 10 June, India's recoveries exceeded active cases for the first time.[13] Infection rates started to drop in September, along with the number of new and active cases.[14] Daily cases peaked mid-September with over 90,000 cases reported per-day, dropping to below 15,000 in January 2021.[15]

A second wave beginning in March 2021 was much larger than the first, with shortages of vaccines, hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and other medicines in parts of the country.[15] By late April, India led the world in new and active cases. On 30 April 2021, it became the first country to report over 400,000 new cases in a 24-hour period.[16][17] Health experts believe that India's figures have been underreported due to several factors.[17][18][19][20]

India began its vaccination programme on 16 January 2021, and by April was administering 3–4 million doses a day.[21][22] India has authorised the British Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield), the Indian BBV152 (Covaxin) vaccine, and the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use. As of 25 May 2021, the country had administered over 200 million vaccine doses.[23][24]
